  <h1>SAMSUNG TOP COMPETITORS</h1>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="column2">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Apple's iPhone</h2>
     <p id="p1">Apple’s Iphone is without doubt the number 1 Samsung competitor when we talk about high end smartphones. Almost every year, there are 3 smartphones sure to be launched. One would be an Iphone, another a Samsung Note and the third Samsung galaxy or Samsung galaxy edge. Iphone was one of the first phones to come out in the market with multi touch features.<br><br>
     However, although Iphone is loved by many, Samsung utilised Google Android to launched several features of its own, including some awesome hardware. The Apple vs Samsung (Android) debate is endless. Apple Iphone has the lions share of Smartphones in US and it is second highest market share holder worldwide and is one of the strongest Samsung competitors in the business</p><br><br><br><br>

     <h2>LG's OLED TV</h2>
  <p> With LG being the top manufacturer of OLED TV panels worldwide while Samsung Display dominates QLED panels for TVs, the LG TVs versus Samsung TVs debate can easily turn into an OLED vs QLED question. If you're looking for a stronger, crisper contrast in your image and colors, with deeper blacks that don't gray out on your TV screen, many would tell you to go with an OLED panel. And they wouldn't be mistaken: This rich contrast and true black is what has made OLED technology so popular, particularly for home theaters and dark rooms.
    <br><br>
  However, if All your smart things are important to you, Samsung has SmartThings, one of the most popular and widely compatible home automation systems. Many of the latest Samsung TVs double as a SmartThings Hub, able to connect smart devices like compatible smart lights and plugs, via Wi-Fi. Samsung also has the option of purchasing a separate SmartThings Hub Dongle for your Samsung TV, to add Zigbee devices to your system.</p><br>
